# GridView FullScreen Gallery
Android Gridview and Fullscreen Gallery with images coming from assets folder dynamically, so NO need to specify one by one files to display in the gallery. Instead, just specify the folder name, and it shall auto retrieve and display all files in folder. Additionally, Glide integrated for smooth and responsive GUI experience.

Enjoy :)
